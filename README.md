# kernel_ft_playground
An important skill for any cryptographic security tester is knowing how to perform functional testing of Linux kernels. But how does one come to acquire this skill? Among the list of answers to that question, this project hopes to sit comfortably and enticingly! 

### What is this Project?
By nature, working with kernels can be quite tricky and, depending on the environment, even risky! With the help of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), this project allows you to learn the basics of the Linux kernel and how to do functional testing on it in a totally isolated and reproducible environment. More importantly, one of the central goals of this project is to demonstrate a specific functional testing workflow that is intuitive, organized, and systematic.
